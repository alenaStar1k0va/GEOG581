This repo contains a collection of projects that were completed with P5.js



## Project 1: Getting started with P5.js
This is my very first attempt at data visualisation with P5. I have prior experiencce with Python, Java, R, Stata, and SAS. It should be noticeable that most of my experience is related to data visualization with the help of variety of statistical software, but I never had to deal with manual mapping of data points in pixel space.

## Project 3: Incorporating P5.js libraries and JS.

The ultimate goal of this assignment/project was to learn how to use extended p5 libraries to read and map data provided by an API. I chose to map earthquake data provided by the USGS. The second (and final) rendition of this project was done with Leafle - this copy is the one I presented in class. However, I first tried to complete this project with Mappa. I ran into some design issues with the Mappa copy so I switched to Leaflet. Visually, I like Mappa version better, it just looks clean. Below, you will find both versions.

## Project 4: Multivariate Data Visualisation with p5.js

Central goal of this project was to visualise panel data. This project includes Leaflet (code provided by Andre Skupin Ph.D), grafica.js, and SAS generated PCA analysis.
