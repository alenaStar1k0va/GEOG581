This repo contains a collection of projects that were completed with P5.js



## Project1: Getting started with P5.js
This is my very first attempt at datavisualisation with P5. I have prior experiencce with Python, Java, R, Stata, and SAS. It should be noticeable that most of my experience is related to data visualization with the help of variety of statistical software, but I never had to deal with manual mapping of data points in pixel space.
